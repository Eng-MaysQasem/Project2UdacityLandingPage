   - The navigation menu is automatically generated based on the sections defined in the HTML.
   - As new sections are added, the navigation menu updates without any manual intervention.
   - Each navigation link is clickable and provides smooth scrolling to its respective section.

### 2. **Active Section Highlighting**
   - The section currently visible in the viewport is highlighted, making it clear to the user which section they are viewing.
   - The corresponding navigation link in the menu is also highlighted for better accessibility.

### 3. **Smooth Scrolling**
   - Clicking on any navigation link results in a smooth scrolling effect, enhancing user experience.

### 4. **Scroll-to-Top Button**
   - A button appears once the user scrolls past a certain point.
   - Clicking this button scrolls the page back to the top with a smooth animation.

### 5. **Collapsible Section Content**
   - Each section includes a "Read More" button that toggles additional content visibility.
   - This feature makes the layout cleaner and allows users to control what content they want to view.

### 6. **Responsive Design**
   - The landing page is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on devices of all sizes, from mobile to desktop.

## **How to Add a New Section**

One of the standout features of this project is its ability to adapt dynamically to new content. Adding a new section is as simple as:

1. **Add the HTML for the new section**:
   ```html
   <section id="section4" data-nav="Section 4">
     <div class="landing__container">
       <h2>Section 4</h2>
       <p>Content for Section 4 goes here.</p>
       <p>Additional content for Section 4.</p>
     </div>
   </section>
